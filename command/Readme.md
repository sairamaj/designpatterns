Behavior Pattern

# Intent
* Represent an action as an object
* Decouples clients that execute the command from the details and dependencies of the command logic
* Enables delayed execution
 * *  Can queue commands for later execution
 * *  If command objects are also persistent, can delayacross process restarts
