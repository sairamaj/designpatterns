# Intent
* Structural pattern
* Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that two can vary independently.
 * Publish interface in an inheritance hierarchy, and bury implementation in its own inheritance hierarchy.
 * Abstraction and implementation are coupled.
 * Beyond encapsulation, to insulation
