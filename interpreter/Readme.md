# Overview
 Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

 * Barcode language ( interprets the bar codes)
 * BNF ( Backus normal form - define a grammar)

Composite and Interpreter are similar (but Interpreter has some rules.)
